# Initially, there is a Robot at position (0, 0). Given a sequence of its moves, 
# judge if this robot makes a circle, which means it moves back to the original place.

# The move sequence is represented by a string. And each move is represent by a character. 
# The valid robot moves are R (Right), L (Left), U (Up) and D (down). 
# The output should be true or false representing whether the robot makes a circle.

# Example 1:
# Input: "UD"
# Output: true
# Example 2:
# Input: "LL"
# Output: false

# My Method:
class Solution:
    def judgeCircle(self, moves):
        """
        :type moves: str
        :rtype: bool
        """
        a = 0
        b = 0
        for i in moves:
            if i == "U":
                a += 1
            elif i == "D":
                a -= 1
            elif i == "L":
                b += 1
            elif i == "R":
                b -= 1
        return a==0 and b==0
        
# Thinkingï¼š
How far in one direction and how far is back in this direction, 
Then it means can be back to the original place.
